== Introduction ==
IBus-Indic-Table is the IM Engine framework for table-based input methods, and is
forked from ibus-table whose Project Owner & Developer is Yu Yuwei <acevery@gmail.com>,
with contributions from Caius "kaio" Chance <cchance@redhat.com>.
The aim of IBus-Indic-Table is to provide a table based boosted environment
for SCIM style tables.
Definitly, it is far from perfect, so if you have any wish or any
suggestion, please send me an email <nav007@gmail.com>, I would be very please to hear
from you :)
